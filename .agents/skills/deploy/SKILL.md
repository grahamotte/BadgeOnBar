description: Deploy `origin/master` to production. Use only when the user explicitly invokes `$deploy`, asks to use the deploy skill by name, or a Linear card says to run the deploy skill.

# Deploy

`mise deploy` fetches `origin` and deploys `origin/master`, whatever is checked out locally. Only merged changes are deployed.

1. Run `mise deploy`. It takes several minutes. It prints `deploying origin/master <sha>`; record the SHA.
2. If it fails because of a trivial problem in the repository, fix it through a PR:
   - Work on the card branch when running for a card, otherwise on a new branch from `origin/master`.
   - Run `mise test` and deliver the fix through the supplied repository review instructions.
   - Link the fix PR to the deploy card.
   - Retry `mise deploy` only after the fix PR has been merged and verified under the supplied repository review instructions.
3. If a failure is not trivial, or is outside the repository (server, DNS, provider, credentials), stop. Do not work around it with manual server changes. Make the failure and its impact immediately clear, with the relevant log output from `deploy/log/`.
4. When the deploy succeeds, report the deployed SHA, any PRs merged along the way, and anything notable from the run.

## Results

Report the deployed SHA and any fix PRs. When blocked, report the failure and what is needed to unblock it. Record results on the invoking card when present; its lifecycle follows the supplied Mr. Moto workflow.
